//! # smart-core
//! The Smart Files engine. Everything a file manager *does* lives here; nothing it *looks like* does.
//!
//! * [`vfs`]      – storage abstraction (`Vfs`), with local disk, memory, ADB phone providers
//! * [`search`]   – query language, cached index, fuzzy ranking, content scan
//! * [`ops`]      – copy/move/trash/delete jobs across providers with progress + cancel
//! * [`devices`]  – real mount / unmount / eject, phones, network
//! * [`apps`]     – default app + “Open With…”
//! * [`backend`]  – the facade frontends use: call methods, `poll()` events
